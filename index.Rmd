# About 

I am an Associate Staff Biostatistician at the Cleveland Clinic in the Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, with a joint appointment in the Taussig Cancer Institute. I also hold an academic appointment as Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. 

My research interests are in early phase clinical trial design and statistical methods for observational studies, with applications to oncology.

I earned my MS degree in biostatistics from The University of Minnesota and my DrPH degree in biostatistics from Columbia University.  

Please see my [CV](./files/Zabor-Emily-CV.pdf) for details of my academic work.


# Tutorials

[Survival analysis in R](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/survival_analysis_in_r_tutorial.html): A detailed tutorial on conducting survival analyses in R, including an introduction to the basics of survival analysis, landmark analyses and time-dependent covariates, competing risks, and a selection of advanced topics.


# R Software

- **{ppseq}**: A package of functions to design clinical trials with sequential Bayesian predictive probability monitoring for futility. Currently functionality is available for one-arm and two-arm clinical trials, and functionality for basket trials is under development. Details at [http://www.emilyzabor.com/ppseq/](http://www.emilyzabor.com/ppseq/)

- **{riskclustr}**: A package of functions for the study of etiologic heterogeneity. Details at [https://www.emilyzabor.com/riskclustr/](https://www.emilyzabor.com/riskclustr/)

- **{condsurv}**: A package for conditional survival analysis. Details at [https://www.emilyzabor.com/condsurv/](https://www.emilyzabor.com/condsurv/)

My interest is in using data as a tool to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to breast cancer research through my work as a Research Biostatistician at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) in the department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics. 

I graduated from the [University of Minnesota](http://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/biostatistics/) with a MS in biostatistics in 2010. In 2012 I began working toward my DrPH in biostatistics as a part-time student at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of etiologic heterogeneity in epidemiologic studies under the advisement of [Dr. Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) at Columbia University and [Dr. Colin Begg](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/colin-begg) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I expect to graduate by the end of 2018.

I am an avid R enthusiast, including serving on the board and being an active member of [R Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/).

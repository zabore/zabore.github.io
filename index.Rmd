My interest is in using data as a tool to answer research questions and test hypotheses. I recently joined the biostatistics faculty at Cleveland Clinic in the [Department of Quantitative Health Sciences]((https://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/)) with a joint appointment in the Taussig Cancer Institute. Previously, I worked for nine years as a research biostatistician  at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the [Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics), where I worked primarily in breast and urologic cancers.

I graduated from the [University of Minnesota](http://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/biostatistics/) with a MS in biostatistics in 2010 and from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) with a DrPH in biostatistics in 2019.

I am an avid R enthusiast and an active member of [R Ladies NYC](https://rladies.org/).

## The basics

Survival data are time-to-event data that consist of a distinct start time and end time.

Examples from cancer:

- Time from surgery to death
- Time from start of treatment to progression
- Time from response to recurrence

## Examples from other fields

Time-to-event data are common in many other fields. Some other examples include:

- Time from HIV infection to development of AIDS
- Time to heart attack
- Time to onset of substance abuse
- Time to initiation of sexual activity
- Time to machine malfunction

## A rose by any other name

Because time-to-event data are common in many fields, it also goes by names besides survival analysis including:

- Reliability analysis
- Duration analysis
- Event history analysis
- Time-to-event analysis
